// Example to show how return ends the function
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello everyone");
  console.log("Hope you are doing good");
  return;
  // Here the local execution context ends
  console.log("Its too hot here"); // This is skipped as we had a return in last line
}

hello();
console.log("I love icecream");
